# Doomer Intro

This is all about the Udemy course  **"A master guide to gang of four design patterns & SOLID design principles using Java"**

**Almost 99% of this site's content is written by AI. (Google Bard). If you find some cringy stuff, it's written by me, rest all AI. No idea bro, it's easy and actually made me understand and allowed me to tick those boxes on Udemy. AI could actually overtake humanity ðŸ’€**

Some of the topics might not be listed in the upcoming stuff (slides? not sure), likely because the course I read was minified (curated to the core I believe). 


Some of the code might use TypeScript along the way. It's not too different from JS. Almost the same syntax. Like `implements` instead of `extends` while inheriting classes. In TS, implements means, it uses the interface but doesn't inherit. Extends inherits the parent class. Almost the same, but different.
